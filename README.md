# python_inverse-kinematics
inverse kinematics

In this project, we had to apply the inverse kinematics in Python and specifically we used some libraries for visualization and animation the robotic arms like graphics and tkinter. The graphic's library was for the display of the workspace and arms and the tkinter was for the pop up dialogs and to insert variables. The main concept was that, we had to insert the lengths of arms and the coordinates of the end effector, to find the angles of joints. We have two solutions and we choose which one we want. Finally, if we want we can add new coords and we are going to see that the arm's are moving to the new point.
